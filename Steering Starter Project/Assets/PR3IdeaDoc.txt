football-esque game?
need collision behavior, but on impact stop steering
target type
- looks where going
- avoids collision with enemies
- seeks towards goal
defender type
- looks where going
- pursues closest enemy to target
- separates from friendlies
attacker type
- looks where going
- pursues target
- separates from friendlies

soccer game?
need collision behavior:
- when collision is detected, will use velocity of both to calculate momentum transfer
- disable steering for 0.25 seconds?
need characters that act like players
defender type
- looks where going when far from target
- looks at target when close
- pursues the closest enemy player to the ball
- separates from close friendly players
- avoids collision with the ball
- avoids walls
forward type
- looks where going when far from ball
- looks at ball when close
- avoids collision with enemy players
- separates from close friendly players
- tries to hit the ball towards the goal
  - path following?
    - define a vector from the center of the goal entrance to the ball
    - place a path target to the side of the ball, on the same side of this vector as the player
    - place another path target directly behind the ball
    - place the final path target at the center of the ball
    - select which path target to choose based on position of player relative to ball
      - for instance, if the player is already behind the ball the side path target is unnecessary
- avoids walls
need to implement dragging of players for positioning
need to implement defender/forward behavior selection
need soccer arena, curved corners are ideal, with a goal
enemy positioning and behavior selection is randomized between a few presets
